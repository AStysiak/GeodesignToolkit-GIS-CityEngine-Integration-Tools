Contained in these tool boxes are optimizations in the data driven visualization process for CityEngine.
The point of these two script is to potentially reduce the entire process for data driven visualization by 50-80%
depending on the number of scenarios/cross sections being dealt with. They are not as robust as the standard method, 
but did speed up creation process considerably. 
If you want more information about these scripts and their patterns, please contact me personally either on linked in, 
github, or some other method. They are not for sale, but I am open to sharing them with specific parties depending
on their use case.
